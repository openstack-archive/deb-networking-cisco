    """This class acts as a manager for device drivers.

    The device driver manager  maintains the relationship between the
    different neutron logical resource (eg: routers, firewalls, vpns etc.) and
    where they are hosted. For configuring a logical resource (router) in a
    hosting device, a corresponding device driver object is used.
    Device drivers encapsulate the necessary configuration information to
    configure a logical resource (eg: routers, firewalls, vpns etc.) on a
    hosting device (eg: CSR1kv).

    The device driver class loads one driver object per hosting device.
    The loaded drivers are cached in memory, so when a request is made to
    get driver object for the same hosting device and resource (like router),
    the existing driver object is reused.

    This class is used by the service helper classes.
